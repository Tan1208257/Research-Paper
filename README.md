# Research-Paper
A Novel Approach for Data Retrieval from Identity Cards Using Deep Learning
## Tools Used
- EasyOCR → A Python-based OCR package used for extracting text from scanned images, including support for 70+ languages.
- PyTorch → A deep-learning framework (based on Torch) used for implementing and supporting deep learning models.
- OpenCV → A computer vision library used for preprocessing steps such as noise removal, grayscale conversion, and image adjustments.
- Matplotlib → A Python plotting library, used here for bounding box visualization (box plotting) of extracted text.
- NumPy → Used alongside Matplotlib for numerical computations.
- EAST (Efficient and Accurate Scene Text Detector) → A deep-learning-based method for text detection in images, particularly useful for text/non-text segmentation
